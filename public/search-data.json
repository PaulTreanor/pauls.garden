If someone was interested in doing this here are my suggestions:\n\n### Business validation/market analysis\nI found that there was real demand for websites, ecommerce, email address setup, and Google Maps setup for local businesses. People actually reached out to me through word of mouth and referrals, but Facebook groups are the most effective place to look for leads. The local and even national competitors in this field are generally all pretty amateurish. \n\n### Why I didn't like the work\nFor starters working with clients is stressful. Getting their business means negotiating. They tend to not really see it as a collaborative thing so you end up having to pester them for even basic stuff like a few images relating to their business. And they tend to have absolutely no ability to even use a computer so they struggle with that. Feature creep is also a massive issue. \n\nIt's also just stressful to make the sites. There's almost always going to need to be some sort of graphics work involved which requires a very specific non-programmer skill and is insanely time consuming. You have to figure out what the site will look like, write the content, and continuously get feedback and iterate. It takes as many hours to make a very simple website 3 page for a small business as it does to make a reasonably ambitious coding side project. All this means that it's very difficult to get an hourly wage of a reasonable dev job\n\n### Building from scratch is a mistake \nMy biggest mistake was that I was trying to code the websites from scratch. It made every site a software development project instead of a \"how to make this business more money\" project. **I would absolutely recommend dropping your ego and using Wordpress** instead of something like React or 11ty. Yes you won't be able to make things as unique and perfect but no one cares. The bar for these sites is very low, and a thoughtfully made Wordpress site will be much better than most local business websites. \n\nIf you are successful a client will ask you to make a site where they can sell things or a site where they can easily write and update a blog. Building a *good* ecommerce application or a blogging engine in React is a monumental undertaking and you will likely fail, just use Wordpress. \n\n### Marketing thoughts \n- Every client wants a custom email address with Gmail - this is a service you can provide. \n- Provide a set of services, not just \"I will build you websites\". Be able to implement each service quickly.\n- Because a smart local biz web developer will use Wordpress they can market quick turnarounds. \n- Transparent pricing is underused by competitors but most sites take roughly the same amount of time.\n- Understand exactly how you will make your clients money. \n- Focus on your own site - at the very least it should have good SEO otherwise why would anyone hire you?\n- Price things slightly hire than you think.

I'd love to make this into a proper blog post but I'd like to get a bit more experience before I do that.*\n\n#### Oversharing personal issues at work is a bad idea\nIn my first few years as a software developer I was occassionally guilty of getting stressed out by work, and then treating my 1-to-1s with my manager as a sort of informal therapy session. \nAnd I wasn't unqiue either, this is a very common theme. On /r/cscareerquestions. It's a very easy pattern to fall into when you don't have the skills to deal with work stress, but it's a bad idea. \n\nNot bringing too much of your emotions to work is an important boundary to maintain. A lot of the time it's downstream of not letting your mental health get effected by work in the first place, but if your job is stressing you out or making you anxious, bringing those unprocessed feelings back into work creates a viscious cycle.\n\nThere is productive ways to complain about work stress to your manager, but making it too personal and every week is unproductive. \n\nYou and your manager have different incentives and goals in terms of your employments, which means oversharing can undermine your career growth. If you're constantly venting about deadlines then your manager can't trust you to handle the pressure. You won't get more responsibility because you seem like you won't be able to cope. You'll never get a reputation as someone who can be relied on when the going gets tough. \n\nUnless your manager is in a position to fix the issue (sometimes stressful situations are just part of the job and can't be fixed immediately) then venting just strains your professional relationship. \n\n#### The alternative\nA better approach to constant complaining is to develop various skills that make up the quality that we call professionalism. This is how you maintain good work/life boundaries and address the issues causing work to be stressful in the first place. \n\n#### Table stakes for managing work stress/anxiety/boundaries \nBefore you can really address stress and anxiety using professionalism you need to tick these 4 boxes: \n\n**1. Develop a strong worth ethic**\nThis is the most important step - if you don't trust yourself to work hard then you will always, deep down, blame yourself when things go wrong. If you consistently work hard then you won't let yourself get pushed around. \n\n**2. Get some wins under your belt**\nFix some bugs, help ship a small feature, use your understand of a system to save the day. The feeling of being valuable at work gives you the confidence to enforce boundaries. \n\n**3. Be serious about moving on if job's not right**\nSome environments are just bad for you. If you won't actually look for a new job when things get out of control then you have no leverage. \n\n**4. If you are struggling consider talking to a therapist**\nThey can be tremendously helpful.\n\n#### Vital professionalism skills to manage stress\nDeveloping these have made busy weeks and months at work much easier for me: \n\n**1. Communicate early and often to stakeholders**\nFor bigger riskier tickets give your manager a few brief updates as you go along. If you think you might get blocked by someone else (e.g. deployment timing issue), let them know ahead of time so you can coordinate. If you are trying to build/debug something and you're not getting anywhere, reach out to someone as soon as you run out of ideas and start flailing uselessly. Err on the side of oversharing, even if that means posting updates to entire Slack channels. \n\n**2. Have a network of people at work who can help you**\n\n**3. Giving estimates**\n- Avoid giving estimates unless pressed \n- Don't give into pressure to give short estimates at all costs. Short inaccurate estimates help no one and hurt everyone invovled. \n- Assume everything will go wrong, including things you didn't even think could go wrong. \n- **Always give estimates as a range** (e.g., \"3 weeks if everything goes well, 6 weeks if things go wrong\"). It sets more realistic expectations and helps you ignore the pressure to commit to an overly optimistic timeline.\n- As work progresses and the release date approaches, your estimate range should naturally narrow. If it doesn’t, it’s a red flag that something might be off with the project’s scope, understanding, or execution.\n\n\n**4. Handling deadline pressure**\nDeadlines are often set arbitrarily by people with little technical context, like PMs or management. The work will take as long as it takes, and it’s not your responsibility to fulfill unrealistic promises others made on your behalf.\nTrust in your good work ethic—you already try your best every day.\nDeadlines can and often should be adjusted as work progresses. They’re not set in stone.\nOccasionally, pushing to meet a deadline can be valuable, such as ensuring increased capacity before a high-demand event like Black Friday. Know when it’s worth making the extra effort.\n\n**5. Be mindful about work life boundaries**\n- Take your full lunch break, especially when working from home \n- Don't work late unless there's a very good reason so\n- Don't look at Slack on your phone after hours \n\n**6. Learn to say no**\nIf you are very busy and someone who isn't your manager tries to put more work on your just tell them to ask your manager, and then ask your manager what to prioritise. \n\n**7. Cover your technical weakpoints**\nIf a technical issue that you don't fully understand keeps happening you'll get more stressed and frustrated each time you fail to fix the issue. \n\nA situation of conflicting git histories on protected branches arose at work. My lack of really deep understanding around how GitHub implements \"rebase and merge\" made this more stressful for me than it needed to be. I have since learned as much as possible about GitHub merge strategies and workflows so resolving this issue is easier if it arrises again. \n\nCommon issues like this - git, CORS, debugging, async code, auth\n\n**8. Take your annual leave wisely** \nHonestly try to take some annual leave as soon as possible if work gets stressful. \n\nAlways leave a day or two unbooked in the last few months of the year, and then take them around Christmas/let them rollover. Just to keep them for an emergency.\n\n\nUsing bank holidays and weekends to stretch out the number of days off work you have a time absolutely makes your time off more relaxing. \n\n**9. Master the art of raising concerns**\nInstead of explaining how impractical and stressful a deadline is to your boss in an emotional way, *raise your concerns*. The magic phrase is \"I have concerns about (things you have concerns about)\". For example. \"I have concerns about meeting the deadline because we haven't accounted for the authentication integration with Google.\".\n\n- Be precise about why you have concerns\n- If there's an existing estimate or deadline, give a new estimate range.\n- Provide some options - ie. leave functionality out, push deadline out, etc.\n- Don't bring any emotions into it, this is a normal thing that happens all the time. \n- Shows you're solution-oriented\n- Maintains your professional credibility\n\n**10. Only work on the most important task(s) each day**\n\n\n### Final thoughts\nIf you don't have the skills to navigate the stressful parts of software development it can be crushing. Encourage younger coworkers and juniors to value their mental health first and teach them some of these professionalism skills.

They aren't. \n\n### Local models would be incredibly useful \nI think the usecases for running LLMs locally on your phone really obvious. They can give you instructions for emergencies (e.g. changing a flat tyre). You can use them as a sounding board for thinking out load, with full confidence that the conversation will remain private. You can look something up without having access to the internet (e.g. a long flight). This isn't even considering the countless integrations that could be really useful (e.g. it could read your notes app). \n\n### Apps for running small models have gotten better \nA year ago the best app for running local models on Android was MLC Chat, which was crap. Now there's Pocket Pal LLM which is way better. LLM Studio is also excellent on desktop compared to older more barebones approaches like llama.cpp\n\n### Models \nOpen source models that can run on powerful desktops (in my case, my MacBook) have gotten significantly better, but 999 times out of 1000 if I'm using my laptop then I have an internet connection. \n\nSo models that can run on smartphones (where I'm regularly without a good internet connection) are potentially far more useful and interesting, but the issue is that the models are just bad right now. llama-3.2-7B runs slow on my S21 Ultra (granted, kind old but very high end phone) and it's responses are just not useful whatsoever. \n\n### Stuff I need to look more into \nI have a little bit more looking into this problem to do. I'm particularly interested in the Gemma model that's built into Chrome now, and I'm sure that there is better models I can run with Pocket Pal on my phone, I just need to experiment a bit more. I'm not an expert in this stuff so absolutely sure there is better ways to run better models on my phone, but I think this is a rough lay of the land in early 2025. \n"},{"slug":"2025-02-05-object-orientated-ux","title":"","date":"2025-02-05","tags":["tech"],"content":"[Cursed](https://uxdesign.cc/what-is-object-oriented-ux-19e14c435d18)"},{"slug":"2025-02-12-potato-bread","title":"Really nice fast homemade potato bread","date":"2025-02-12","tags":["thingsilike","notcode","food"],"content":"\nThese blow potato bread you buy from the shop out of the water and they come together really quickly. \n\n## Ingredients\n*Don't worry about ratios too much it's not a precise recipe.*\n\n- 200g of self raising flour\n- 70g butter (I suspect ~30-40g would be fine and far healthier)\n- 350g plain mashed potatoes\n- Big pinch of salt\n\n## Method\n- Cut the butter into the flour (it doesn't need to be perfect)\n- Knead for ~60s until it turns into a nice dough, not too wet, not too dry. \n- Roll dough into 1.5cm sheet and cut out your scones\n- Place in 200°c oven for 20-25 minutes (until lightly browned)\n\nEnjoy.
