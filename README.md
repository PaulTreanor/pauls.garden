## Paul's Garden

This is the code for [pauls.garden](https://pauls.garden), a personal digital garden for publishing notes on the web.

The site is a static website built with Next.js and MDX for content. 

The site is hosted on Vercel and automatically deploys when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Running the site 

```bash
# Install dependencies 
npm install

# Local development server (run on http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev 

# Production build (build files in /out directory)
npm run build

```
