I first tried v0.dev when it was announced back towards the end of 2023 and I thought it was cool but it didn't seem like it added that much value on top of GPT-4. 

I tried it again today (January 11th 2025) and it absolutely blew me away. It has improved faster and more noticeably than any other AI coding tool I've used in that time, like it's unsettling. I encourage you to play around with it and maybe even spend some money on it. 

The implications for frontend devs are pretty obvious, but it's worth looking at how you use it for your own gains...

There's this class of very small personal tools that I find myself making every few months - a [GCal datepicker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tiny-calendar/aadffibnfkmdgacogepcbkhfaoacohnp), or a [time tracker for work](https://paultreanor.com/time-tamer)... I've had mixed results trying to [make these types of tools in Claude Artifacts](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/), but v0 can just one shot them and handle **way** more complex stuff. I have a feeling that this specific product will be incredibly important.
