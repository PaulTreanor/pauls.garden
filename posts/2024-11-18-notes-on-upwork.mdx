Last year during my [little self-directed work phase](https://paultreanor.com/next-step) last year I had a look into Upwork for a few days. It's not even worth looking at. 

It's too much noise, too hard to break into, and too stressful. It's a numbers game but the payoff just isn't worth it. 

The platform itself is pay to play and has this kind of unprofessional icky gamified feel to it. It seems like there's some work there for people who are *really* desperate or got started pre-COVID, but starting out in 2023 a complete waste of time. I'm sure it's only gotten worse as AI has advanced further. 

Don't knock on the same doors as everyone else.
