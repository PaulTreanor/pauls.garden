**Look around it**
- Milky oil cap
- Leaks (fresh oil) around engine connections and hoses
- Engine should be clean
- Tyres
- Rust on panels (cosmetic or totally rotten?)
- Rust underneath (axles, etc)
- Rust on door hinges

**Documentation**
- Service history
- Engineers report (for campervan conversion)
- Paperwork for parts (new engine, etc)
- When is the next service due?

**Test drive**
- Go up and down through all the gears
- Reverse
- Emergency stop
- Acceleration
- Left and right turns
- Wheel bearings OK?
- Everything must be perfect for daily drivers
