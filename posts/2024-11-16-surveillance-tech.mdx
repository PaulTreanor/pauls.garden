Take a random selfie and put it into [PimEyes](pimeyes.com)...the implications are insane. Reverse face search is the single scariest publicly available tech I have ever personally encountered...and that's just what's publicly available.

Every stalker is now an expert detective. You've been tagged in every photo you've ever accidentally appear in. No matter where you go, you can be instantly identified. It's all already quietly happened. 

**What does it mean?**
1. Wearable devices with cameras are a security threat to everyone and should be banned outright.
2. Posting pictures of your children or anyone else online means they'll probably get scraped by these creepy companies.
3. Keeping your mobile # and home address off the internet is vital, otherwise they could be found in ~20 seconds by a stranger taking your picture.
