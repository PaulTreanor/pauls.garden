I think about how great [Randnautica](https://www.reddit.com/r/Randonautica/) is every few months. It might be the best viral app of all time.

We're used to apps zapping our attention and taking a bit of colour out of real life. Randnautica was the exact oppposite - it gave it's users a bit of mystery, like a folklore creating machine. I hope I can make something so wonderful someday.
