I commute about 80 minutes each way, three days a week.It's mostly motorway, but I often drive to a train station halfway and take the train the rest of the way into the city. I've done this for over a year now, here are some things I've learned:

- **Android Auto/CarPlay is priceless**. It lets me anticipate bad traffic in the city and drive to the train station instead, and being able to move between podcasts and music is so nice. I highly recommend getting an aftermarket Android Auto headunit installed if you car doesn't have one, it's so worth it for commuters (even though it cost me Â£350). 
- Wear gloves in the car on cold winter mornings!
- Only ever use all-seasons/winter windscreen washer fluid. 
- Cruise control makes motorway driving much more comfortable. I imagine an automatic gearbox would do the same for heavy traffic.
- Keeping your car clean and tidy does wonders for your mood.
- If you are tired it is never worth trying to push through. I always pull over at the next filling station and get a coke. 
- Bringing a travel cup of tea in the morning is a lovely way to start the day. recommend the [smash](https://retail.smashproducts.com/uk/product-category/coffee-drinkware/) or [circular](https://circularandco.com/shop/reusables/circular-reusable-coffee-cup) travel cups.
- Good entertainment options are incredibly important for enjoying your commute. If you intend on commuting for more than a few months then it's worth investing dozens of hours into exploring new podcasts that you genuinely look forward to listening to. [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) is the best free podcast app.
- If you aren't into full albums then commuting is a good opportunity to start. Ask your pretentious friends for recommendations!
- Keep a positive mindset. If you are looking for reasons to hate your commute you will find them.
