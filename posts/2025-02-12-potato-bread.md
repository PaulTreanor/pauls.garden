These blow potato bread you buy from the shop out of the water and they come together really quickly. 

## Ingredients
*Don't worry about ratios too much it's not a precise recipe.*

- 200g of self raising flour
- 70g butter (I suspect ~30-40g would be fine and far healthier)
- 350g plain mashed potatoes
- Big pinch of salt

## Method
- Cut the butter into the flour (it doesn't need to be perfect)
- Knead for ~60s until it turns into a nice dough, not too wet, not too dry. 
- Roll dough into 1.5cm sheet and cut out your scones
- Place in 200Â°c oven for 20-25 minutes (until lightly browned)

Enjoy. You can put them in the fridge and reheat them the next day but they aren't as nice.
