Yes, I know there is a way to do them right...they are good for detecting unintended side effects...they are for mature applications...but I just don't think they're worth it.

1. What are you even testing? Tests should have names describing what you're testing, snapshot tests don't.
2. They are flakey by design. Flakey tests are bad.
3. Everyone ignores them anyways so none of their benefits matter.
4. They waste everyone's time, over and over and over again.
