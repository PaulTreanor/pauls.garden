You can use the GitHub issues of a private repo as a really nice journal. 
- It's secure and forces MFA
- It's available everywhere and GitHub has a great mobile app
- You can embed links/media
- Isssue threads have comments with dates that are nice for long running themes
- Easy to archive stuff by closing issues
