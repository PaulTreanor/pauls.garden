### Adding shortcuts 
Pressing `cmd+K cmd+S` will open the keyboard shortcuts. 
1. `cmd+shift+L` -> outputs console log
2. `cmd+o` -> replaces `cmd+p` as go to file binding (to make it the same as obsidian.md)
3. `cmd+shift+m` -> inline fold toggle

### Useful built-in keyboard shortcuts 
- `cmd+k, v` - Markdown editor
- `opt + click` - multi cursor
- `cmd + d` - find duplicates to multi cursor
