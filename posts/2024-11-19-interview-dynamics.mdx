Something that stood out to me about this [article detailing the current tech job market](https://matt.sh/panic-at-the-job-market) is the comment about how it seems like some interviewers are almost trying to make you feel small. 

> "The entire industry just kinda accepts candidates should have negative and personally degrading interview experiences where candidates are undermined by some vague sense of social superiority from the interviewers."

I think rigorous coding interviews are fine but I have felt this exact atmosphere in an interview before. Being in a position to decline offers from these places feels so important for our self worth.
